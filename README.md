### About Me

I am currently studying the Common Core curriculum at 42 School.
You can check out my school projects here -> https://github.com/42-common-core-arturo

42 School is an innovative programming school that offers a unique approach to learning computer science. Unlike traditional universities, 42 School focuses on a project-based, peer-to-peer learning model with no formal classes or teachers. Students learn by completing various projects, primarily in the C language, to understand fundamental computer science concepts through hands-on coding experience. As students progress, they tackle C++ projects, which lay a solid foundation for learning new programming languages and technologies.

### What I have learnt at 42 School

During my time at 42 School, I have worked on a variety of projects that have strengthened my understanding and skills in key areas of software development and computer science:

- **Algorithm Implementation**: Implemented various algorithms and data structures to solve computational problems efficiently.
  
- **Systems Programming**: Gained proficiency in low-level programming concepts such as memory management and system calls through projects like Pipex and Minishell.

- **Shell Scripting**: Created functional UNIX shell environments in projects like Minishell, demonstrating command execution and process management skills.

- **Graphics Engineering**: Developed applications that utilize 2D and 3D graphics rendering techniques, enhancing user interface and visualization capabilities.
